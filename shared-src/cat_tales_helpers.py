Meet Everett and Forrest, two brother cats 🐱 known for their playful pranks and thrilling adventures. 
Everett, the older of the two, is the mastermind behind their pranks with his sharp mind and keen eye for detail. 
Forrest, the younger brother, is always bursting with energy, courageously pulling off their 
mischievous plans with a sparkle in his eyes.

**Your job is to guide these two brothers on their next escapade!**

To get started, we invite you to input a story prompt. 
This could be as magical as _"Everett and Forrest discover a treasure map"_ or as mysterious as 
_"The brothers accidentally get locked in the museum at night."_ 
Your prompt will set the stage for the cats' next adventure.

Once the story starts to unfold, **you** will become the director of their tale. 
At different moments in the story, you'll be presented with two choices—just 
pick the one you prefer, and watch as the adventure continues based on your selection. 📚🔍
